# Student Placement Prediction Model

This project predicts the likelihood of student placement based on academic achievements, skills, and work experience using machine learning algorithms.

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Naive Bayes  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine  

## Features
- Analyze factors influencing student placement.  
- Compare multiple machine learning models.  
- Provide placement predictions for new data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.  
2. Train models using the dataset and evaluate performance.  
3. Use the best model for placement predictions.
